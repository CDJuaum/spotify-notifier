IMPORTANT:  
there might be a slight bug while opening chrome and getting the token since the method I used to get it depends on x and y positions of the mouse, so if you run into any trouble with that, access the sit I'll leave bellow, create your token as user-read-currenlt-playing and copy it to your clipboard, then run the app.
